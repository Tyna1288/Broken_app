# Broken App Issues

1. The code lacks structure which makes i difficult to read, understand and maintain.
2. The code is not efficient as it makes a seperate API call for each developer and as such ineffective if there is a large number of developers. Thus making a single API call to get all the developers was the major correction in the code.
